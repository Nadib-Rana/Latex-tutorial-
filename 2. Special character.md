### Some common characters have special meanings in LaTeX:
```laTex
percent sign (%)
hash (pound / sharp) sign (#)
ampersand (&)
dollar sign ($)
```
### Example in LaTeX showing how to use these special characters:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

% This is a comment and won't appear in the document.

Here is a percent sign: \%.

The hash sign is used to denote parameters: \#1.

We use the ampersand for alignment in tables:
\begin{tabular}{cc}
A & B \\
C & D \\
\end{tabular}

To display a dollar sign, use: \$100.

In math mode, you can use dollar signs to include equations:
\[ E = mc^2 \]

\end{document}
```

In this example:
- `%` is used to start a comment.
- `#` is used in the context of a custom command (not shown in this example but is used in defining commands).
- `&` aligns columns in a table.
- `$` delimits mathematical expressions.
